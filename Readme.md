Laravel Workflow Engine: Business Requirements Document (BRD)
Document Version: 1.2 Date: September 12, 2025 
Author: Ryan Lopez
1. Executive Summary
This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Laravel Workflow Engine, a web-based application designed to automate, manage, and track multi-level approval processes. The platform aims to solve the business problem of fragmented, manual approval processes by providing a solution that increases operational efficiency, reduces bottlenecks, and provides compliance-grade audit trails. The system will empower non-technical users to configure workflows without coding.
The platform provides:
•	A visual, flowchart-driven workflow builder.
•	A dynamic form builder with field-to-variable mapping.
•	A robust approval engine with conditional logic.
•	Auditability and transparency across all requests.
2. Business Objectives
•	Efficiency: Reduce approval cycle times and manual intervention by at least 50%.
•	Transparency: Real-time visibility of request status and bottleneck points.
•	Accountability: Immutable logs of actions and decisions.
•	Flexibility: Low-code/no-code ability for admins to build workflows and forms.
•	Integration: REST API + Webhooks for ERP, HRIS, and financial systems.
•	Scalability: Support enterprise-grade workloads with thousands of concurrent requests.
3. Project Scope
In-Scope
•	Drag-and-drop workflow builder with version control.
•	Dynamic form builder with reusable templates.
•	Approval engine with conditional, sequential, and parallel flows.
•	User management & RBAC (Requester, Approver, Admin + custom roles).
•	Dashboards with filtering, SLA tracking, and pending/approved requests.
•	Notifications: Email, Slack, MS Teams, push (via API).
•	Audit trail with export to PDF/Excel.
•	REST API & Webhooks for integration.
Out-of-Scope
•	Native iOS/Android apps: This is excluded to focus on a single, high-quality, responsive web experience for Phase 1 delivery.
•	Complex BI reporting: Only basic dashboards will be included in Phase 1.
•	Legacy system integration: Only integrations explicitly listed are in scope.
4. User Roles & Personas
•	Requester:
o	Goal: Submit forms easily and track requests.
o	Needs: Simple UX, request history, mobile access.
o	User Story: As a requester, I want to receive an email notification when my request is approved, so I know when to proceed with the next step.
•	Approver:
o	Goal: Review and decide on requests.
o	Needs: Dashboard with pending approvals, inline comments, delegation options.
o	User Story: As an approver, I want to delegate my approval responsibilities to a colleague when I am on vacation, so that pending requests don't get delayed.
•	Administrator:
o	Goal: Configure workflows, forms, and roles.
o	Needs: Full visibility, workflow analytics, error handling tools.
o	User Story: As an administrator, I want to see a log of all changes made to a workflow, so I can easily roll back to a previous version if a change causes an error.
•	Super Admin / Auditor (Future Role):
o	Goal: Monitor compliance across all workflows.
o	Needs: Read-only access to audit logs, reports, and statistics.
5. Functional Requirements
